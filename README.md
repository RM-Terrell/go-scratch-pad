# Go Scratch Pad

A basic Debian based devcontainer for riffing on Golang projects. Contains all the needed software and configuration to be able to compile, run, unit test, and most importantly debug Go code in VS Code. Also includes basic spell checking and markdown linting.

To run a basic Go function you can use `check_check.go` inside the `/src/` folder, and a basic unit test is provided in `check_check_test.go`.
